        Coraline, a short story by Neil Gaiman, tells the tale of an adventurous young girl and her encouter with an evil entity. 
        Upon moving into an apartment in a strange pink house, she finds a small door which leads her into a magical and demonic realm. 
        Here, she meets the "other mother", an evil being which feasts on the souls of children.
        She offers Coraline good food, good toys, friends, and love. All these things are what Coraline longs for in her world, but is denied by neglectful parents.
        However, when the Other Mother tries to make Coraline sew buttons into her own eyes in order to steal her soul, Coraline escapes home.
        When she returns, she finds her parents missing.
        In order to save her parents, she returns to the Other Mother's world.
        Here, she engages in a seeking game, in which she has to find the lost souls of the Other Mother's previous victims.
        After successfully finding these souls with the help of a mysterious black cat, she captures her parents who had been trapped in a snowglobe.
        Through her wit, she is able to trick the Other Mother and is able to return home. 
        Upon her return, she destroys the key to the other realm and learns to appreciate the normal-ish life she has.

        Below is a digital illustration that I did. Although it is not Coraline-themed, it is a spooky Wednesday Addams theme, which is similar in my opinion.
